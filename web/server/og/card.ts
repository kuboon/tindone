/**
 * The social card, drawn with Skia.
 *
 * A link to a page is a title, a line of description and nothing else until someone renders it —
 * so this draws the page's own words onto a 1200×630 canvas and hands back a PNG. It is the whole
 * of the drawing: what a card says is decided next door in `mod.ts`, and this only knows how to
 * put words on a rectangle.
 *
 * `canvaskit-wasm` is Skia compiled to WebAssembly — the text stack a browser uses, minus the
 * browser. That matters for the part that is hard: a title is arbitrary length and the box is not,
 * so it has to be shaped, wrapped, and cut with an ellipsis at a line count. Skia's paragraph API
 * does that, and it does it with the same shaper the page itself will use.
 *
 * The palette is the app's pink, restated below — CSS custom properties are resolved by a
 * browser, and there is no browser here.
 *
 * The fonts come from `fonts/`, whatever is in it, and Skia falls back through them per glyph — so
 * a Japanese title is Japanese and the Latin around it is still Inter. A character nothing covers
 * is reported rather than silently drawn as a box; see `report` and `fonts/README.md`.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or the clock, so a card is a pure function of its text — which
 * is what lets `server/og.ts` hand it out with a long cache lifetime.
