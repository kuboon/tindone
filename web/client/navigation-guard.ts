/**
 * The two navigations the runtime should not be handling, handed back to the browser.
 *
 * Calling `@remix-run/ui`'s `run()` starts a Navigation API
 * listener that intercepts every same-origin navigation it can. Two of those are not navigations
 * at all in the sense the runtime means, and intercepting them is a regression rather than an
 * enhancement:
 *
 * - **A jump to a `#fragment` on the page you are already on.** The browser moves the scroll
 *   position and nothing else. Intercepted, it becomes a fetch of the whole page and a full
 *   reconciliation of the DOM, re-hydrating every island to do what the browser does for free.
 * - **A reload.** F5, the toolbar button, `location.reload()`. Intercepted, it reconciles the new
 *   HTML into the document that is already open, which is very nearly a reload except for the part
 *   people reload *for*: component state survives it. A counter at 3 is still at 3 afterwards.
 *
 * Remix's own documentation site ships this same guard in its browser entry, with a comment saying
 * to remove it once `remix/ui` ignores these itself, so this is a workaround with an expiry date
 * rather than a disagreement with the framework. Check it against `@remix-run/ui`'s changelog when
 * bumping the version, and delete this file when it lands upstream.
 *
 * `stopImmediatePropagation()` in the capture phase is what hands the navigation back: the
 * runtime's own listener never sees the event, so it never calls `intercept()`, and the browser
 * does what it would have done with no JavaScript on the page at all. It has to be installed
 * before `run()` for the capture-phase ordering to be guaranteed.
