/**
 * The client runtime, started once per document.
 *
 * `run()` walks the document for the hydration markers `renderToStream` emitted and hydrates each
 * one, importing the module the server named for it. That name is a real URL by the time it
 * reaches here — `assets.ts` resolved it during render — so this hook is the whole of it.
 *
 * The shell loads this as a `<script type="module">` on any page that hydrates, and on no other:
 * the done list places no client entry, so it ships no JavaScript at all.
 *
 * `run()` also takes over same-origin navigation, which is what makes a plain `<a href>` on a
 * hydrated page a soft navigation. Two kinds of navigation are handed back to the browser first —
 * see `navigation-guard.ts`.
